Its layout is different from the usual, and its arched windows are a reference to its oriental past. After the conquest of Szigetvár, Müezzinzade Ali began to build the church, then a mosque. Ali Pasha was killed in 1571, but the mosque continued to be built and was completed by 1589. For a hundred years afterwards, until the recapture of Szigetvár, it was a Muslim place of worship.",
      "line2": "The mosque was first used as a gunpowder storage, then in 1788 it was consecrated as a Catholic church in honor of St. Rocco and altered inside and out. The minaret next to the building was destroyed by lightning in 1715. Both the entrance hall and the dome were dismantled and the arched windows were converted into baroque ones.",
      "line3": "The church was renovated in the 1980s, retaining the Turkish style features, which include arched windows and stalactite decorations in the corners of the interior.",
      "line4": "In the dome there is a Baroque fresco by István Dorffmeister. The font is from the former Turkish baths."
